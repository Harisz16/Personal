                White cardboard boxes are normally used for packaging and
                shipping, organization, storage, and often used in the food and
                retail industries.
              </p>
              <p class="content">
                Companies that aim for a cleaner look on their packaging but
                also want a strong and durable box, prefer white cardboard
                boxes.

                Not only does this minimize the amount of wasted space during
                shipping, but it saves on the need for excess packaging products
                – such as foam packaging peanuts to fill that extra space;
                another factor that can help save you money.

              <p class="content">
                Screen printing is an effective technique for creating bold
                canvases, posters and artwork, but the method can also be used
                to print fabrics and textiles, so it's great for creating all
                sorts of custom clothing and products.
              </p>
              <p class="content">
                Screen printing is a printing method that uses a plate (screen
                mask) that uses a “screen mesh,” which is woven with synthetic
                fibers such as polyester or metal fibers such as stainless
                steel. It is a type of “stencil printing,” which prints on
                target objects by passing ink through the mesh of a screen mask.
